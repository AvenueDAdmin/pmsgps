## How It Works

PMS GPS uses scientific research on how hormone fluctuations affect mood, preferences, and behavior throughout a woman's menstrual cycle to provide timely recommendations that help men be more attentive partners.

Simply input basic information about each partner's cycle, and the app will:

1. Calculate their current cycle phase
2. Predict upcoming phase changes
3. Provide tailored recommendations
4. Send optional reminders when important phase changes are coming

## The Science Behind It

Research shows that women's preferences, mood, and behavior can vary predictably across their menstrual cycle due to hormone fluctuations:

- **Menstrual Phase**: Often accompanied by lower energy and potential discomfort
- **Follicular Phase**: Rising estrogen leads to increased energy and positivity
- **Ovulation Phase**: Peak estrogen and testosterone increases sociability and confidence
- **Luteal Phase**: Declining hormones may lead to lower energy and increased sensitivity

PMS GPS uses this knowledge to help you be a more attentive and understanding partner.
